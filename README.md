### What is this repository?

Once upon a time one travel company was thinking about redesigning their mobile version of airtickets metasearcher.
It was a hot discussion during which one person proposed to put aircraft image inside the ticket and the idea was greately approved by others.
Since developers couldn't find a proper source of those images it was proposed to scrap it by themselves.

### TODOs

* Aircraft manufacturers
  * Add Bombardier aircrafts and liveries - No source :x:
  * Add Embraer aircrafts and liveries - <a href="https://www.embraercommercialaviation.com/" target="_blank">source</a>, no liveries
  * Add Sukhoi aircrafts and liveries - No source :x:
* Add option for lossless resizing and transformation to different dimensions

<b>Important:</b> if you know any source of aircrafts images with different liveries then please create an issue. I'll be very thankful.
