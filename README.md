### What is this repository?

Once upon a time one travel company was thinking about redesigning their mobile version of airtickets metasearcher.
It was a hot discussion during which one person proposed to put aircraft image inside the ticket and the idea was greately approved by others.
Since developers couldn't find a proper source of those images it was proposed to scrap it by themselves.
